# CodeSoft AI Internship Repository

Welcome to the CodeSoft AI internship repository! This repository contains projects and exercises designed to help you develop your skills in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Below is an overview of the three main tasks included in this repository:

## 1. Chatbot with Rule-Based Responses

Build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. This project aims to give you a basic understanding of natural language processing and conversation flow. You will implement if-else statements or pattern matching techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate responses.

## 2. Tic-Tac-Toe AI

Implement an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. You can use algorithms like Minimax with or without Alpha-Beta Pruning to make the AI player unbeatable. This project will help you understand game theory and basic search algorithms.

## 3. Recommendation System

Create a simple recommendation system that suggests items to users based on their preferences. Techniques like collaborative filtering or content-based filtering can be used to recommend movies, books, or products to users. This project will introduce you to the fundamentals of recommendation systems and personalized user experiences.
I have made  Movie recommendation system built using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a content-based approach. The system is designed to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and movie descriptions. It utilizes a dataset containing 5000 data points of movies.
